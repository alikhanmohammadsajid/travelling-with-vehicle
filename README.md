I am trying very hard but I can't complete this assignment. I fixed the backgronud image. I also fixed home, destination and log in (link) in the nav bar. In front of the background image I fixed bike, car, bus and train. When you click the bike, car, bus and train firstly you should login before go to the destination and I fixed it.I create form in destination component and private route in destination component. For login I used google authentication from firebase app.
